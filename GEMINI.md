# Project Overview

This is a React project, likely a portfolio or a desktop-like application, built with Vite and TypeScript. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and ESLint for linting. The project structure suggests a component-based architecture with state management handled in `src/store`.

## Key Technologies:
- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- ESLint

## Project Structure:
- `public/`: Static assets including icons and wallpapers.
- `src/`: Source code.
  - `assets/`: Contains static assets like `react.svg`.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components, categorized into `apps`, `container`, and `directories`.
  - `store/`: State management logic, likely using a library like Zustand or Redux.
  - `App.tsx`: Main application component.
  - `index.css`: Global CSS styles.
  - `main.tsx`: Entry point of the React application.

## Conventions:
- Component-based architecture.
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- TypeScript for type safety.
- ESLint for code quality and consistency.
